plot a model to the lc data
plot a model to the flares


***maybe at a later stage, make ignored command have arguments
	ignore flares
	ignore ...

try and figure out why shell is freezing :)))
		think it might be when user starts typing again before the plot has fully loaded
		try googling this but first confirming this is the case


plotting powerlaw will now successfully plot the data
model shouldn't plot the powerlaw
when plot data -> if model = true then plot data and model

model powerlaw -> store variables -> so can run again with improved variables?
need to output fit statistics
plot data ratio -> two graphs

incorporate several part model
	plot powerlaw+powerlaw
	adding breaks and adding sections



after fitting a model, print the model and parameters
maybe don't plot it straight away
give plot data (auto shows the model) and plot model commands


when adding a model, do i need to make self.currentmodel for the whole class?
think i do for when i want to store model data so i can plot, do error command etc

how to get scipy to spit out errors on parameters and also fit statistics
how to change fit statistics maybe?
what other things can i allow users to vary for fitting?

write my own fit commands maybe?


output the rise time, decay time, peak time, duration for each flare


# python will crash after replotting several times
# ion -> clear/draw clearly isn't the best solution
# but only if something gets plotted too fast?

# maybe indent help: indent command usage line and descriptions


# next:

# help for model
# how to add subhelp topics for models
    # under help model
    # if no text after model just print normal model help
    # if there is text, need to use a command like inp.strip() to take it apart
    # then see what the second arg is equal to, and print the correct model help

# take user input for models
# and output the fit nicely
# maybe don't plot automatically, similar to xspec

# ignore the later data or pc data



# make ignore and show commands more concise
# maybe remove one of them
# automatically ignore data when you do flares ??
# automatically plot data even if ignored in modelling?


# add a show command and hide command for flares?

# is show flares variable a class variable?
# this is easy in this case
